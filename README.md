Data Management

## Class 2 Intro:
Optional Reading- EF Codd “A Relational Model of Large Shared Data Banks.”

Proposed a relational model. 

Everything begins with business rules. 
Business rules are statements that confine or constrain policies, etc. 
Are expressed in terms familiar to end users. 
Are automated through DBMS software. 

## Class 2
Good business rule is:
Declarative, preceise, atomic, consistent, expressible, distinct, business-oriented.
Who/what/when/where/and why for organizations. 

This is the first step of the business process. Without a good understanding of the business rule, the result will be flawed.
