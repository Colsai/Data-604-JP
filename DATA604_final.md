Where does Data Virtualization fit in terms of 

(PDM Ch. 17 Ch. 18 590-601, 617-620) 
### 1. Concepts with respect to how cloud computing works
- How does cloud computing work, how is it different from on-premise data centers  
- Why do people choose one over the other?

### 2. Hadoop Frameworks:
- What are the different components of Hadoop, and how do they work together
HDFS: Hadoop distributed file system, the files in the big data database. 
YARN: Yet Another Resource Navigator 
MapReduce: A programming model that allows for queries to be run quickly based on an efficient use of map-reduce function
which is distributed over many servers. 

- (What is used for transformation: Hive; SQL: Impala)

### 3. What is Spark, what is MapReduce, and how does it work with respect to the Map Frameworks.
MapReduce is a programming model that breaks down data so that it can be manipulated by different nodes in the network.
Spark is a replacement framework that allows for additional processing of data. It is being used as a replacement for MapReduce. 

### 4. What is massively parallel processing? 

### 5. Distributed Computing:
How does SPARK framework work, how does it relate to the Big Data environment. 

### 6. Visualizations
No questions on Tableau, but questions about data visualization

### 7. Distributed - Virtualization
How do virtual machines work, how can you carve out a physical machine into multiple machines

- "What is virtualization?
Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware." (IBM)

### 8. Parallel Computing & GPU Computing
No questions on nVidia CUDA, etc. Must understand how they are different from previous iterations.

### More:
- What is the SQL landscape
SQL still has great applicability, as many relational databases still exist. Relational Databases . Additionally, SQL-like languages are able to be used with. 
OLTP: 
OLAP: 
Data Warehousing: 
What is used for decision-making
What is used for operational decisions

All the Types of Databases:
What is a Value-Store Database:
What is a Graph Database:
What is a Column Database: 

- What is Cap Theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem
- How are noSQL databases implemented
- What types of workloads, what OLTP, OLAP, Data Warehousing, what is used for decision-making and machine learning, etc.
- What is a value-store database, what is a graph database, etc.

## Also on MongoDB:
Notes on Exercise:
- No hands-on kind of work, only the conceptual aspects of each of these frameworks. 
- (Won't be "What is X, how does it work?")
